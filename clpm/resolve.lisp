;; * Explanation
;;
;;   The primary task performed by this package is going from requirements to a
;;   minimal set of releases that resolve all the requirements. The general
;;   approach taken is to perform a search over the space of all releases until
;;   a satisfying combination is found. However, the space of all release
;;   combinations is enormous, so we need to guide it somehow.
;;
;;   This is probably the most complicated part of CLPM. It could likely still
;;   benefit from improvements, but this implementation should be correct. The
;;   non-trivial aspect of this is, of course, grovelling for dependencies from
;;   ASD files. In this case, we have little to no metadata to work from and
;;   must instead rely on locally examining ASD files to extract the information
;;   needed. However, pulling information from these files could result in
;;   running arbitrary Lisp code. Additionally, if any ASD system is a
;;   package-inferred-system, then dependency information will be scattered
;;   throughout the release files *and* there is no guarantee that all the
;;   subsystems will be reachable from the primary system... This is where the
;;   groveller comes in. However, the groveller must be properly managed, and
;;   new grovellers may need to be instantiated as we backtrack while performing
;;   the search.
;;
;;   The state of the search at any point in the search tree is described by
;;   five things:
;;
;;   1. A list of unresolved requirements. It starts with all provided
;;      requirements.
;;   2. A list of unresolved requirements needed to grovel. It starts empty and
;;      the search is complete when both this list and the previous list are
;;      empty.
;;   3. A list of activated releases. These are the releases chosen so far to
;;      satisfy some requirements.
;;   4. A list of activated system releases. These represent systems provided
;;      by the releases that are actually required (either directly or
;;      indirectly).
;;   5. A list of system files that need to be added to the groveler.
