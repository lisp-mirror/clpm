#+TITLE: CLPM Changelog

* v0.4.0 - Unreleased

  + Changed layout of release tarballs.
  + Published tarballs now contain a static executable (#11).
  + No longer using the deploy library to build releases (#15 #11).
  + Updated build script to more easily build static or dynamic executables
    (#11).
  + Fixed bug in computing the source-registry.d file for the clpm client (#16)
  + Starting to build up a test suite (#3)
  + Added automated testing on Gitlab CI.
  + Added =clpm-client:*activate-asdf-integration*= to control default
    integration with ASDF upon context activation.
  + The default directories for CLPM cache, config, and data have changed on
    Windows. They are now =%LOCALAPPDATA%\clpm\cache\=,
    =%LOCALAPPDATA%\clpm\config\=, and =%LOCALAPPDATA%\clpm\data\=.
  + Added new config option =(:grovel :lisp :command)=. This string is split
    via shlex into a list of arguments that can be used to start the child lisp
    process.
  + Deprecated =(:grovel :lisp :path)= in favor of =(:grovel :lisp :command)=.
  + Added new value for =(:grovel :lisp :implementation)= - =:custom=. When
    =:custom= is used, no arguments are taken from the lisp-invocation library,
    the user must specify a command that completely starts the child lisp in a
    clean state.
  + Better support for using MSYS2's git on Windows.
  + Support for Mac M1 (#20).
  + Fixed bug causing groveling to take an inordinately long time for systems
    with =:defsystem-depends-on= or direct calls to =asdf:load-system= in their
    system definition files (!9).
  + Fixed bug causing unused git and asd directives to linger in
    =clpmfile.lock= (#32).
  + Add support for bare git repos in clpmfile (not from Github or
    Gitlab) (#22).
  + Add clpmfile =:api-version= ="0.4"=. Remains backwards compatible with
    0.3. (#22).

  Fixes from the aborted 0.3.6:

  + Fix bug saving project metadata on Windows.
  + Fix client's UIOP dependency to better suit ECL's bundled fork of ASDF.
  + Fix issue READing strings in client from a lisp that is not SBCL (#13).
  + Parse inherited CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY config in client using ASDF (#14).


* v0.3.6 - 2021-01-11

  Note that this release never got published. There was a build and packaging
  issue. These fixes will be released in 0.4.0.

  + Fix bug saving project metadata on Windows.
  + Fix client's UIOP dependency to better suit ECL's bundled fork of ASDF.
  + Fix issue READing strings in client from a lisp that is not SBCL.
  + Parse inherited CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY config in client using ASDF.

* v0.3.5 - 2020-11-11

  + Fix bug in ordering releases for semantic versioned projects that include
    prereleases.

* v0.3.4 - 2020-07-08

  + Fix bug in parsing contexts referring to git commits when the git repo is
    not yet present on the filesystem.

* v0.3.3 - 2020-06-29

  + Fix bug in client that caused CLPM to stall when too much was printed to
    its stderr.

* v0.3.2 - 2020-06-08

  + Fix bug in client where =activate-context= did not ignore inherited source
    registries for bundles.
  + Sort more things serializing contexts. Should prevent excessive noise in
    bundle lock files.

* v0.3.1 - 2020-06-04

  + Fix bug in CLPI when interacting with dual-sources
  + Fix bug parsing :version dependency forms from ASDF.

* v0.3.0 - 2020-05-30

  + Pull HTTP client into separate library
    (=clpm-multi-http-client=). Additionally, this library supports connection
    pooling with Drakma, so make Drakma the default on non Windows platforms.
  + Pull ASDF system groveler into separate project.
  + Pull CLPI documentation and implementation into separate project.
  + Pull QL integration for CLPI into separate project.
  + Add =(:grovel :lisp :implementation)= and =(:grovel :lisp :path)= for
    controlling what Lisp implementation is used by the groveler.
  + Installing releases now writes project and release metadata to CLPM's data
    dir. This allows the CLPM cache to be cleared, but have data on installed
    projects remain.
  + Add the =(:log :level)= config option for controlling log verbosity.
  + Add =--no-resolve= option to =bundle install= to prevent re-resolving
    requirements when you know the lock file is up to date.
  + Client largely rewritten to launch a CLPM process and use a REPL to
    communicate instead of translating everything to CLI invocations.
  + Client's INSTALL and UPDATE functions made much simpler and more
    featureful.
  + Client's dribble features improved greatly.
  + =source-registry= CLI added.
  + =output-translations= CLI added.
  + =exec= CLI added.
  + =activate-context= function added to client to allow changing source registry
    and output translations of the current image.
  + Add =bundle init= CLI and =bundle-init= in client to easily create a new
    clpmfile.
  + =client source-registry.d= CLI added to generate source registry config so
    ASDF can find the client.

* v0.2.1 - 2020-04-05

  + Rebind =*debugger-hook*= so that CLPM never drops into debugger.
  + Wildcard config options (such as for HTTP headers) can now be discovered
    purely from environment variables.

* v0.2.0 - 2020-04-03

  + Major rewrite of metadata storage. All source data is now stored in flat
    files that are read on demand.
  + Thread support is no longer mandatory.
  + Config and clpmfile{,.lock} formats have changed.
