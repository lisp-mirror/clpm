* Intro to CLPM

** What is it?

   CLPM stands for Common Lisp Package Manager.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
   CLPM has several primary goals:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
   1. Manage packages in both global and project specific contexts.
   2. Use existing libraries where possible.
   3. Support HTTPS.
   4. Do as little work as possible in the development image.

** Terminology

   Below are some common terms used by CLPM and in this tutorial:

   + Package :: This is typically used in the colloquial sense, meaning some
     unit of software that is installed. There is an unfortunate collision with
     [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/11_a.htm][Common Lisp's packages]], but hopefully what is meant is clear based on
     context.
   + System :: An [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]] defined system.
   + Project :: Primary development unit of code. Typically corresponds to the
     contents of a single VCS repository. May contain multiple systems.

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   + Release :: A versioned snapshot of a project.
   + System release :: A snapshot of a system contained within a project's
     release.
   + Source :: Typically used to refer to a repository of projects, releases,
     and metadata, such as [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]].
   + Context :: A set of requirements and installed releases that satisfy said
     requirements.

** Architecture

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='leftcol'>
   Two major pieces:

   + CLPM :: The core of the package manager, intended to be run in a separate
     process. Additionally, has a command line interface for use outside of
     Lisp.
   + CLPM Client :: A small, portable system meant to be loaded into
     development images. Launches CLPM processes and communicates with them
     using a REPL.

   #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='rightcol'>

   #+begin_src plantuml :file architecture.svg
     Client -> CLPM: Start process
     activate CLPM

         Client -> CLPM: (install :systems '("fiveam") :context "default")
         CLPM -> Client: t
         Client -> CLPM: (source-registry :context "default")
         CLPM -> Client: (:source-registry ...)
         Client -> CLPM: (quit)
     deactivate CLPM
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:architecture.svg]]
   #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

*** Architecture Benefits

    This architecture is different from existing solutions (see: [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]],
    [[https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot][Qlot]], and [[https://qi-cl.com/][Qi]]). It gives us some very nice benefits, though:

    1. CLPM can load and use foreign libraries you likely do not need in your
       development image (such as OpenSSL).
    2. CLPM can use existing libraries without bloating your image or dumped
       executable footprint.
    3. CLPM can use existing Lisp libraries without introducing version or
       package conflicts in your development image.
    4. CLPM can take advantage of implementation specific features without
       sacrificing portability.

** Contexts

   CLPM supports two types of contexts.

*** Global Contexts

    Global contexts have a name and all information about these contexts is
    stored in the CLPM data directory.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
    Similar in spirit to Python virtualenvs (at least those created with
    [[https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper/][virtualenvwrapper]]).

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    Additionally, can write information to standard ASDF source-registry
    locations (see: ~(:contexts "NAME" :source-registry-files)~ config option),
    so ASDF can find the systems without involving CLPM at all. Great for
    installing libraries for global use or when working on projects by
    yourself.

*** Bundle/Anonymous Contexts

    Identified by a pathname, typically to a file named =clpmfile=.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
    Designed to be portable, so it can be shared (e.g., in a git repo):

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
    + =clpmfile= contains sources and top-level requirements.
    + =clpmfile.lock= contains the same information, but also includes the set
      of releases that satisfy the requirements. =clpmfile.lock= is enough to
      recreate the context on another machine.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 2
    Project local configuration of CLPM (such as overriding git checkouts to
    use a copy you already have cloned) accomplished using a file
    =.clpm/bundle.conf= (relative to =clpmfile=).

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 3
    Inspired by Ruby's [[https://bundler.io/][Bundler]] and [[https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot][Qlot]]. Great for working on a project with
    many collaborators and deploying projects using a known, working
    configuration.

** Requirements

   Contexts are specified by the user via /requirements/. CLPM understands
   several types, described below. The included examples show how to specify
   that requirement in a =clpmfile=.

*** System requirement

    A system requirement says that a specified system and all its dependencies
    must be available in the context. Can specify:

    + A version range (refering to the ASDF parsed system version). However,
      this is not currently available for Quicklisp sources as that data is not
      present in the metadata.
    + The source from which to install the system.

    #+begin_src common-lisp
      (:system "fiveam")

      (:system "cffi"
       :version ((>= "0.20.0")))
    #+end_src

*** Project requirement

    A project requirement says that all of a project's systems, and all of the
    dependencies of its systems must be available in the context. Can specify:


    + A version range, refering to the version number of the release, which may
      or may not correspond to the version of any system contained in the
      release (depending on the project developer's practices). For Quicklisp
      sources, the release version is date based.
    + The source from which to install the project.

    #+begin_src common-lisp
      (:project "fiveam")

      (:project "cffi"
       :version ((>= "2018-10-20")))
    #+end_src

*** VCS Project requirement

    Similar to a project requirement, except it states that the project must be
    checked out from version control. Can specify:

    + Branch, tag, or commit.
    + The repository (required if the source metadata does not include VCS
      information).

    Note that any system or project directly included in the context via this
    type of requirement satisfies *any* version constraint specified by other
    explicit or implicit requirements.

    #+begin_src common-lisp
      (:project "cffi"
       :vcs (:branch "bugfix-1"))

      (:github "cffi"
       :branch "bugfix-1")
    #+end_src

*** System File Requirement

    This requirement states that a specified .asd file located on the local
    filesystem, outside of one of CLPM's directories, is included in the
    context, as well as any dependencies of the systems defined in it. Can
    specify:

    + Path to the .asd file.

    Note that with this type of requirement, you may need to occasionally have
    CLPM reresolve the requirements. For instance if you add a new dependency
    since the last time you asked CLPM to install things into the context. How
    to do this is covered in the demos below.

    #+begin_src common-lisp
      (:asd "super-awesome.asd")
    #+end_src

** Sources

   CLPM can understand two types of sources for package metadata

*** Quicklisp

    Quicklisp style sources are those that are also compatible with the
    Quicklisp library manager. These sources version releases of projects by
    date.

    There are several disadvantages to Quicklisp sources:

    + They contain no system version information.
    + They routinely do not contain all the dependencies for ASDF
      [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html#The-package_002dinferred_002dsystem-extension][package-inferred-systems]].
    + They do not contain version control information for projects.
    + CLPM cannot (yet?) lazily download metadata, an explicit sync step is
      required that may take some time.

*** CLPI

    CLPI based sources are defined by the [[https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/clpm/clpi][CLPI Project]]. This source
    specification was created to serve CLPM's needs, so it contains the
    information for all of CLPM's features, and is designed to enable lazy
    syncing. However, it is nowhere near as mature or battle tested as
    Quicklisp's metadata format.

    #+REVEAL: split:t
    A mirror of the main Quicklisp distribution is stored in CLPI format at
    [[http://quicklisp.common-lisp-project-index.org/]]. However, it is a straight
    translation of the Quicklisp metadata and is missing the same
    information. The CLPM author plans to eventually extend it to include at
    least better dependencies for package-inferred-systems and system version
    information. If you choose to use this mirror, realize that it is currently
    a best-effort project.

** What files does it touch?

   CLPM expects to read and write files in several locations on your hard
   drive. This section summarizes them.

*** Config

    CLPM's configuration is stored in the =clpm/= subfolder of your [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html][XDG]] config
    directory. The typical locations for your XDG user config directory are:

    + Linux :: =/home/$USER/.config/=
    + MacOS :: =/Users/$USER/.config/=
    + Windows :: =C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Local\config\=

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    This can be overriden using the =CLPM_CONFIG_DIRS= environment variable.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    Last, when using bundles, CLPM will project specific configuration from the
    =.clpm/bundle.conf= file, relative to the =clpmfile=.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    CLPM does not currently write to config locations, but may in future
    versions.

*** Cache

    CLPM caches many files during its operation, including tarballs and package
    metadata. These files are stored in the =clpm/= subfolder of your XDG cache
    directory. The typical locations for your XDG cache directory are:

    + Linux :: =/home/$USER/.cache/=
    + MacOS :: =/Users/$USER/.cache/=
    + Windows :: =C:\Users\$USER\AppData\cache\=

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    This location can be overriden using the =CLPM_CACHE_DIR= environment
    variable.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    Typically these files can be deleted any time CLPM is not running and it
    will recreate them as necessary.

*** Data

    CLPM stores context data, unpacked releases, metadata for installed
    packages, etc. in the =clpm/= subfolder of your XDG data directory. The
    typical locations for your XDG data directory are:

    + Linux :: =/home/$USER/.local/share/=
    + MacOS :: =/Users/$USER/.local/share/=
    + Windows :: =C:\Users\$USER\AppData\=

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    This location can be overriden using the =CLPM_DATA_DIR= environment
    variable.

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    You should let CLPM manage these files and not edit them manually.

** Additional features

*** ASDF Groveler

    When installing a release directly from version control or your file
    system, there is no metadata for CLPM to use in order to determine
    dependencies. CLPM uses the [[https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/clpm/asdf-system-groveler][asdf-system-groveler]] in a separate process to
    extract the needed information.

*** Groveler Sandbox (Experimental)

    Unfortunately, groveling from .asd files may involve loading arbitrary
    code. Therefore, CLPM is capable of using [[https://firejail.wordpress.com/][Firejail]] to sandbox the groveler
    process if it is installed. This feature is very experimental, and the CLPM
    author would love to have feedback on it, as well as ideas for other
    sandboxing methods to use!

*** CLPI metadata generation (Very Experimental)

    CLPM has very experimental support for extracting the release metadata
    needed for CLPI metadata and packaging it as JSON for sending to a web
    service maintaining a CLPI index. The author is currently trialing this in
    house. Reach out if you're interested in this feature/running your own CLPI
    index server.

* Initial Setup

** Installing CLPM

*** Linux

    + Download the latest tarball for your system. Assuming you are running an
      amd64 processor on most GNU/Linux distributions, it is currently located
      at
      [[https://files.clpm.dev/clpm/clpm-amd64-linux-gnu-v0.3.1.tar.gz]].
    + Download the signed digests for this version from
      [[https://files.clpm.dev/clpm/clpm-v0.3.1.DIGESTS.asc]].
    + Download the CLPM Signing Key:
      #+begin_src shell
        gpg --recv-keys 0x10327DE761AB977333B1AD7629932AC49F3044CE
      #+end_src
    + Verify the signature on the digests file:
      #+begin_src shell
        gpg --decrypt clpm-v0.3.1.DIGESTS.asc
      #+end_src

    #+REVEAL: split:t
    + Ensure the sha512 sum for the downloaded file matches the one from the
      digests file:
      #+begin_src shell
        sha512sum clpm-amd64-linux-gnu-v0.3.1.tar.gz
      #+end_src
    + Unpack the tarball:
      #+begin_src shell
        tar xf clpm-amd64-linux-gnu-v0.3.1.tar.gz
      #+end_src
    + Install CLPM:
      #+begin_src shell
        cd clpm-v0.3.1 && sudo sh ./install.sh
      #+end_src

*** MacOS

    + Download the latest tarball, currently located at
      [[https://files.clpm.dev/clpm/clpm-amd64-darwin-v0.3.1.tar.gz]]
    + Download the signed digests for this version from
      [[https://files.clpm.dev/clpm/clpm-v0.3.1.DIGESTS.asc]].
    + Download the CLPM Signing Key:
      #+begin_src shell
        gpg --recv-keys 0x10327DE761AB977333B1AD7629932AC49F3044CE
      #+end_src
    + Verify the signature on the digests file:
      #+begin_src shell
        gpg --decrypt clpm-v0.3.1.DIGESTS.asc
      #+end_src

    #+REVEAL: split:t
    + Ensure the sha512 sum for the downloaded file matches the one from the
      digests file:
      #+begin_src shell
        sha512sum clpm-amd64-darwin-v0.3.1.tar.gz
      #+end_src
    + Unpack the tarball:
      #+begin_src shell
        tar xf clpm-amd64-darwin-v0.3.1.tar.gz
      #+end_src
    + Install CLPM:
      #+begin_src shell
        cd clpm-v0.3.1 && sudo sh ./install.sh

*** Windows

    + Download the latest installer, currently located at
      [[https://files.clpm.dev/clpm/clpm-amd64-windows-v0.3.1.msi]].
    + Run the installer.

    NOTE: I do not think gpg is very common on Windows, but if you use it, you
    should be able to figure out what to do based on the instructions for other
    OSes.

** Configuring sources

   Global sources configred in =sources.conf= in CLPM's config directory.

   The demos assume you have Quicklisp configured as a source. Described below
   are two options to do this. See [[*Sources]] for a discussion of pros and cons
   of each.

*** Quicklisp distribution directly

    Add the following to =sources.conf= to use the primary Quicklisp
    distribution directly:

    #+begin_src common-lisp
      ("quicklisp"
       :type :quicklisp
       :url "https://beta.quicklisp.org/dist/quicklisp.txt")
    #+end_src

*** Quicklisp CLPI Mirror

    Alternatively, if you like living on the edge, add the following to
    =sources.conf=:

    #+begin_src common-lisp
      ("quicklisp"
       :type :ql-clpi
       :url "https://quicklisp.common-lisp-project-index.org/")
    #+end_src

** Configuring ASDF

   ASDF needs to be configured to find the =clpm-client= system. Assuming you
   haven't modified your [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html#Controlling-where-ASDF-searches-for-systems][ASDF source registry]] too much, place the output of the
   following command at:

   + Linux/MacOS :: =~.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/20-clpm-client.conf=
   + Windows :: =C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Local\config\common-lisp\source-registry.conf.d\20-clpm-client.conf=

   #+begin_src shell
     clpm client source-registry.d
   #+end_src

** Configuring the Client

   Configure the client by adding code to your implementation's init file.

   Use the following to print the default configuration. Add =--help= to see
   options.

   #+begin_src shell
     clpm client rc
   #+end_src

   #+begin_notes
   The CLPM client can be configured by adding forms to your favorite Lisp
   implementation's initilization script. To use the recommended configuration
   of the CLPM client, place the output of =clpm client rc= in your
   initialization script (for example, =~/.sbclrc= for SBCL).

   CLPM ships with several configurations for the client, depending on your
   preferences. See =clpm client rc --help= for more info (and feel free to
   contribute new configurations!)
   #+end_notes

*** Default configuration

    As of v0.3.1, the recommended configuration is:

    # #+ATTR_REVEAL: :code_attribs data-line-numbers='1-2|5-7|8-9'
    #+begin_src common-lisp
      ;;; Use CLPM with default configuration.
      ;;;
      ;;; Generated by CLPM 0.3.1

      (require "asdf")
      #-clpm-client
      (when (asdf:find-system "clpm-client" nil)
        ;; Load the CLPM client if we can find it.
        (asdf:load-system "clpm-client")
        (when (uiop:symbol-call :clpm-client '#:active-context)
          ;; If started inside a context (i.e., with `clpm exec` or `clpm bundle exec`),
          ;; activate ASDF integration
          (uiop:symbol-call :clpm-client '#:activate-asdf-integration)))
    #+end_src

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    This configuration:

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
    1. Loads ASDF.
    2. Loads the CLPM client if its .asd file can be found.
    3. Activates ASDF integration if launched via =clpm exec= or =clpm bundle
       exec=.

* Demo: Using Global Contexts from the REPL

  This demo shows you how to use CLPM while interactively developing from the
  REPL in a global context. Before continuing, please ensure you have installed
  CLPM and configured the client.

  Additionally, clone the [[https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/clpm/clpm-demo][clpm-demo]] project somewhere. (Undoing any changes you
  made from other demos).

** Start your Lisp!

   Start your Lisp! You can check the client was loaded and it can find CLPM by
   evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:clpm-version)
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/global-repl/version.png]]

** Syncing sources

   If you are using the Quicklisp distribution directly and have not yet synced
   it, do so now.

   This command will likely take a while as it needs to download data for every
   version of the distribution. You do not need to do this step if you are
   using the CLPI mirror.

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:sync :sources '("quicklisp"))
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/global-repl/sync.png]]

** Activating contexts

   Assuming you did not launch your Lisp as a child process of =clpm bundle
   exec= or =clpm exec= (see the CLI demos for more details), the default
   configuration does not activate any context.

   You can activate or switch contexts using =clpm-client:activate-context=.

   If you switch contexts you will get a continuable error. This is just a
   warning that things may break unexpectedly (e.g., you have already loaded
   systems in some context and are now switching to one where they aren't
   installed or a different version is installed.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Activate the =demo= context now by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:activate-context "demo" :activate-asdf-integration t)
   #+end_src

   This queries CLPM for the ASDF configuration for the =demo= context (source
   registry and output translations). Then it configures ASDF in the running
   image with those settings. Last, it hooks into ASDF's system search functions

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/global-repl/activate.png]]

** Installing systems

   You can install systems or projects into a context using
   =clpm-client:install=.

   The systems are installed into the context specified by
   =clpm-client:*default-context*=. If that is NIL (the default), it installs
   into the active context. If there is no active context, it falls back to the
   context named =default=.

   Before modifying the context, CLPM produces a diff and presents it to you
   for approval. The presentation is controlled by
   =clpm-client:*context-diff-approval-method*=. It can be set to:

   + =:error= :: Default. A condition is signaled (using =error=, so you will
     be dropped into the debugger). The restarts =approve-diff= and
     =reject-diff= will be available.
   + =:yes-or-no-p= :: The diff is printed and you are asked for approval via
     =yes-or-no-p=.
   + =t= :: The diff is silently accepted.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Install the CFFI project into the demo context by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:install :projects "cffi")
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/global-repl/install-diff.png]]

   Note how this installs every system that is part of the CFFI project
   (notably pulling in its testing dependencies), instead of only the CFFI
   system and its dependencies.

** Lazily installing systems

   Alternatively, if you have an activated context and the client's ASDF
   integration activated, you can install systems on demand. This works by
   adding a system search function to ASDF, therefore any attempt to find a
   system that is not installed (e.g., using =asdf:find-system=,
   =asdf:load-system=, etc.) will trigger the client.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   How the client behaves in the presence of a missing system can be configured
   by the variable =clpm-client:*asdf-system-not-found-behavior*=. It can be
   set to:

   + =:error= :: Default. A condition is signaled (using =error=, so you will
     be dropped into the debugger). The restarts =install-and-reload-config=,
     =reresolve-requirements-and-reload-config=,
     =install-without-dependencies-and-reload-config=, and =reload-config= will
     be available.
   + =:install= :: The client will attempt to install the system and its
     dependencies without prompting.
   + =:install-without-deps= :: The client will attempt to install the system
     without its dependencies without prompting.
   + =nil= :: The client does nothing.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Note that these settings combine with
   =clpm-client:*context-diff-approval-method*=. Therefore the default behavior
   is to ask if the system should be installed *and* to ask if the diff is
   approved (both using the debugger).

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Lazily load 1am by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (asdf:load-system "1am")
   #+end_src

   Invoke the =install-and-reload-config= restart and then the =approve-diff=
   restart.

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/global-repl/load-error.png]]

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   When new versions of your dependencies are released, you can easily update a
   context using =clpm-client:update=. By default, all projects are considered
   eligible for upgrading (subject to requirements specified via
   =install=). However, only specific systems or projects can be upgraded by
   specifying the =:projects= and/or =:systems= arguments.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   To update everything in the demo context, run:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:update)
   #+end_src

   If you would like to limit the updates to particular systems or projects,
   use the appropriate keywords. For example:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:update :projects "1am")
   #+end_src

   This probably won't do anything right now since you already have the latest
   versions!

** Installing an editable system

   CLPM allows you to "install" a system into a context using a pointer to the
   .asd file on your local hard drive. This is great for developing software as
   you can leave the code in a folder not under CLPM's control, but CLPM will
   still examine it to determine and install dependencies.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Install the clpm-demo project into the demo context by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:install :asds '("/path/to/clpm-demo/clpm-demo.asd"
                                  "/path/to/clpm-demo/clpm-demo-test.asd"))
   #+end_src

   Then load the system by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (asdf:load-system :clpm-demo)
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/global-repl/editable-diff.png]]

** Adding a dependency to an editable system

   Look at =clpm-demo-test.asd= and =test.lisp=. We have a test suite defined
   using fiveam, but we forgot to declare a dependency! Add fiveam to the
   =:depends-on= for the =clpm-demo-test= system:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (defsystem #:clpm-demo-test
       :version "0.1.0"
       :description "CLPM Demo Test System"
       :license "BSD-2-Clause"
       :depends-on (#:fiveam #:clpm-demo)
       :components
       ((:file "test")))
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Now let's run the tests by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (asdf:test-system :clpm-demo)
   #+end_src

   Uh oh, we don't have fiveam installed! This is the perfect time to use the
   =reresolve-requirements-and-reload-config= restart. It will notice the new
   dependency and ask you to install it. Accept the diff and watch the test
   pass.

* Demo: Using Bundles from the REPL

  This demo shows you how to use CLPM while interactively developing from the
  REPL in an anonymous, project specific context (bundle). Before continuing,
  please ensure you have installed CLPM and configured the client.

  Additionally, clone the [[https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/clpm/clpm-demo][clpm-demo]] project somewhere. (Undoing any changes you
  made from other demos).

** Start your Lisp!

   Start your Lisp! You can check the client was loaded and it can find CLPM by
   evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:clpm-version)
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/version.png]]

** Creating the bundle

   A bundle is a project specific context defined by two files.

   =clpmfile= is generated and maintained by the developer. It contains the
   sources and requirements for the bundle.

   The second, =clpmfile.lock= is generated by CLPM. It contains a copy of the
   information from the =clpmfile=, as well as a list of releases that satisfy
   the requirments. Additionally, it contains a dependency tree. This is not
   currently used by CLPM, and at the moment is purely to provide the developer
   information.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Initialize a new clpmfile for the =clpm-demo= project by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:bundle-init #p"/path/to/clpm-demo/clpmfile"
                              :asds '("clpm-demo.asd" "clpm-demo-test.asd"))
   #+end_src

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
   This creates a new file named clpmfile at =/path/to/clpm-demo/clpmfile=. It
   should contain the following:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
   #+begin_src common-lisp
     ;;; -*- Mode: common-lisp; -*-
     (:api-version "0.3")

     (:source "quicklisp" :url "https://beta.quicklisp.org/dist/quicklisp.txt" :type :quicklisp)

     (:asd "clpm-demo.asd")
     (:asd "clpm-demo-test.asd")
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/init.png]]

** Installing the bundle

   Before you can use the new bundle, you need to install the dependencies! You
   can do this using =clpm-client:install=. As you do not have an active
   context yet, you need to specify the context.

   When specifying a bundle as the context, it is required that you use a
   pathname!

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Install all the dependencies for the bundle. Don't forget the =#p=!

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:install :context #p"/path/to/clpm-demo/clpmfile")
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/install.png]]

** Activating the bundle

   Once you have a lock file, you can activate the context specified by the
   bundle using =clpm-client:activate-context=.

   If you switch contexts you will get a continuable error. This is just a
   warning that things may break unexpectedly (e.g., you have already loaded
   systems in some context and are now switching to one where they aren't
   installed or a different version is installed.

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Activate the bundle and the ASDF integration by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:activate-context #p"/path/to/clpm-demo/clpmfile"
                                   :activate-asdf-integration t)
   #+end_src

   And load the system:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (asdf:load-system :clpm-demo)
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/activate.png]]

** Test the system

   Look at =clpm-demo-test.asd= and =test.lisp=. We have a test suite defined
   using fiveam, but we forgot to declare a dependency! Add fiveam to the
   =:depends-on= for the =clpm-demo-test= system:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (defsystem #:clpm-demo-test
       :version "0.1.0"
       :description "CLPM Demo Test System"
       :license "BSD-2-Clause"
       :depends-on (#:fiveam #:clpm-demo)
       :components
       ((:file "test")))
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Now run the tests by evaluating:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (asdf:test-system :clpm-demo)
   #+end_src

   Uh oh, we don't have fiveam installed! This is the perfect time to use the
   =reresolve-requirements-and-reload-config= restart. It will notice the new
   dependency and ask you to install it. Accept the diff and watch the test
   pass.

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/fiveam-error.png]]

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/tests-pass.png]]

** Installing projects from VCS

   Now, let's say you decide that there's a feature in Fiveam's git repository
   you want to use, but it hasn't been released to Quicklisp yet. No worries!
   Add the following to the =clpmfile=:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (:github "fiveam"
      :path "sionescu/fiveam"
      :branch "master")
   #+end_src

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   And reinstall the context (so it gets the new requirement):

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:install :context #p"/path/to/clpm-demo/clpmfile")
   #+end_src

   The diff will show you that it is changing from a released version of fiveam
   to a specific commit from the git repo.

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/fiveam-git.png]]

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   If you retest =clpm-demo= now, you'll see that it recompiles fiveam using
   files from a different location.

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (let ((asdf:*compile-file-failure-behaviour* :ignore))
       (asdf:test-system :clpm-demo))
   #+end_src

   The binding for =*compile-file-failure-behavior*= was required at the time
   of writing as FiveAM's master branch had a package definition in variance
   with the one in the version released in Quicklisp.

** Overriding VCS repos

   Last, let's say you discover a bug in fiveam and want to use a local copy of
   fiveam in your bundle while you fix it. This can be accomplished by cloning
   the fiveam repo next to the =clpm-demo= folder and adding the following to
   =clpm-demo/.clpm/bundle.conf=:

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     ;;; -*- mode: common-lisp; -*-

     (version "0.2")

     ((:bundle :local "fiveam")
      "../fiveam/")
   #+end_src

   This tells CLPM that if it encounters a VCS requirement for fiveam, it
   should be satisfied using the repository located at =../fiveam/= (relative
   to the =clpmfile=).

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   Reinstall the context (so it gets the new override):

   #+begin_src common-lisp
     (clpm-client:install :context #p"/path/to/clpm-demo/clpmfile")
   #+end_src

   In the current diff format, you want see an entry on the diff, but you still
   need to approve it for the change it take effect in the current
   session. This will hopefully be made more clear in v0.4.

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   [[file:screen-shots/bundle-repl/fiveam-override.png]]

   #+REVEAL: split:t

   Using this feature requires great care. If you commit a version of
   =clpmfile.lock= that references a fiveam commit that you have not pushed,
   all of your collaborators will have a bad day and blame it on you!

* Demo: Using CLPM from the CLI

  This demo shows off a subset of CLPM's capabilities that can be accessed
  using its command line interface.

  Most of what was described in previous demos will also work from the CLI and
  now that you know the concepts, the details can hopefully be figured out by
  adding =--help= to any invocation of =clpm=.

  A feature of CLPM that is currently unique to its CLI is the =exec=
  interface. That is described below.

** Executing a process in a global context

   If you would like to use CLPM but not have to deal with the client, you can
   start processes with environment variables set that allow ASDF to be
   configured using CLPM without the client.

   #+REVEAL: split:t
   For example, to run an sbcl process with ASDF configured to use systems
   installed in the =demo= context, run the following command:

   #+begin_src shell
     clpm exec --context=demo -- sbcl
   #+end_src

   The =--= is not required, but highly recommended as it keeps CLPM from
   trying to parse any options given to SBCL as options for CLPM.

   This sets the =CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY= and =ASDF_OUTPUT_TRANSLATIONS=
   environment variables to configure ASDF, along with some others in case you
   choose to load the client in the new process.

** Executing a process in a bundle

   If you would like to execute a command with the environment configured to
   use a CLPM bundle, instead run:

   #+begin_src shell
     clpm bundle exec -- sbcl
   #+end_src

   It defaults to finding =clpmfile= in the current directory, but that can be
   overriden with =-f=.
