PROJECTS and SYSTEMS must be lists of dependency specifiers. VERSION, REF, and
SOURCE must be strings and are used as the default constraints on PROJECTS and
SYSTEMS if such constraints cannot be extracted from the specifiers themselves.

VALIDATE must be a function of one argument (a diff) and returns non-NIL if the
install should proceed.

NO-RESOLVE only has an effect if the CONTEXT is a bundle. If it is non-NIL, then
the bundle will be installed completely from its lock file, without reresolving
any requirements.

If UPDATE-ASDF-CONFIG is non-NIL and CONTEXT is the active context, then ASDF's
source registry is updated with the results."
