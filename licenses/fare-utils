At the insistence of several hackers, I hereby state what is obvious to me,
that they can reuse any software released under the bugroff license
and publish it as part or totality of packages under any other license
they see fit, if it really matters to them, including a BSD-style license
or a MIT license. Yes they can. Of course, if they choose a proprietary
software license, they only deserve scorn. But even that, they may do!
