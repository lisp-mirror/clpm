If no clpmfile.lock file exists, one is created by first syncing all sources in
the clpmfile and using the requirements to resolve a set of project releases
that satisfy them all. All of the releases are then installed locally and the
lock file is written.

If a lock file does exist, all sources are synced and the requirements
re-resolved, but preference is given to installing the releases that already
exist in the lock file.")
